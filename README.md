## Projects Overview

### 1. [Clustering Algorithms with Scikit-learn](Clustering_Algorithms_SciKit_Learn.pdf)
Explored **KMeans**, **DBSCAN**, and **Agglomerative Clustering** on real-world customer datasets. Used Elbow and Silhouette methods to determine optimal clusters, and created 2D/3D visualizations to interpret results.

---

### 2. [Data Wrangling in Python](Data_Wrangling.pdf)
Performed missing value handling, feature engineering, and dataset normalization for a customer transaction dataset.

---

### 3. [Forecasting Stock Prices with LSTM](Forecasting_StockPrices_with_LSTM.pdf)
Built a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to predict future prices based on historical trends, comparing results with ARIMA models.

---

### 4. [Rain Prediction using SVM](Rain_Prediction_Using_SVM.pdf)
Used **Support Vector Machines** to classify rainfall levels based on weather features, evaluating accuracy, precision, and recall.

---

### 5. [Time Series Forecasting with LSTM](Time_Series_Forecasting_with_LSTM.pdf)
Applied LSTM to forecast **energy consumption time series**, focusing on sequence preparation, scaling, and model evaluation.

---

### 6. [Detecting AI-Generated Text using LLMs](LLM_detect_ai_generated_text.pdf)
Explored how **Large Language Models** can distinguish between human and AI-generated text.

---

### 7. [Re-ranking QA Answers with LLMs](LLMs_Hypothetical_Answers_ReRank_QA_T...)
Investigated methods to improve question-answering systems by generating and reranking candidate answers using LLMs.

---

### 8. [XGBoost from Scratch](XGBoost_from_Scratch_in_Python.pdf)
Implemented **XGBoost** manually without libraries to better understand boosting mechanics, tree building, and regularization.

---

### 9. [Recommendation System – Collaborative Filtering](Recommendation_system_collaborative_filltering.ipynb)
Developed a **user-based** and **item-based** collaborative filtering recommendation engine using the Amazon 2023 All Beauty reviews dataset. Built a user–item rating matrix, computed cosine similarity, and evaluated performance using RMSE and precision@k.
